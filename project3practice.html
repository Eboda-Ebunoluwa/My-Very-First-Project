      <p>Thank you for considering  my website worthy of checking.
		I started learing to code just a month ago, normally i 
		didn't know where or how to start from so I mostly focused on the interlectual aspect of coding
		for a long time but know am starting to see that i need more practice in the practical aspect
		and this is one of my first projects and I would love to look back at this later in the future and smile at this.
		Even if i don't get a job now I would love to get or apply for an intership if available "I may have learnt few aspects of some languages but I lack in experience".I really like programming I would be awaiting your responses or advise.<br>Thank you.<br><br>
